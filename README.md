# instance_manager

Python script to start/stop instances in AWS, meant to be run as a Lambda function.

Uses the python-lambda toolset [nficano/python-lambda](https://github.com/nficano/python-lambda) .

## Instructions

### Setup

To setup, create a virtualenv and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### AWS connection

To enable AWS connection you need to configure a default AWS profile in ~/.aws/credentials or provide keys in config.yaml.

### Test run

Once the AWS connection has been configured you can test instance_manager from the local workstation. The file event.json contains sample data for test purposes.

```
{
  "tags": {
    "Purpose": "lambda-testing",
    "Testing": "true"
  },
  "state": "stop"
}
```
Basically the tags given here are matched against the EC2 instance tags and when a match is found the instance state is moved to one of start/stop/terminate/restart which ever is defined here.

Define the tags and state as you want and run the test with command `lambda invoke -v`.

### Create IAM role for instance_manager

instance_manager needs certain access rights to be able to perform its tasks. The easiest way may be to create a new IAM role for it as follows.

1. IAM - Roles - Create New Role
2. Role name = lambda_instance_manager (defined in config.yaml)
3. Select Role Type - AWS Service Roles - AWS Lambda
4. Attach Policy (leave empty) - Next Step
5. Review - Create Role
6. Select lambda_instance_manager role - Permissions - Inline Policies - Create - Custom Policy - Select

Policy Name = InstanceManagerPolicy
Policy Document

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1474026789000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeReservedInstances",
                "ec2:MonitorInstances",
                "ec2:StartInstances",
                "ec2:StopInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Deploy instance_manager to AWS

To deploy instance_manager to AWS, just type `lambda deploy`. (make sure you're deploying to the correct account)

Once the deployment is complete verify that instance-manager (defined in config.yaml) is visible on the AWS Lambda Functions page.

### Create CloudWatch schedule

The final step is to create the CloudWatch schedule to run the lambda.

1. CloudWatch - Rules - Create Rule
2. Event Source - Schedule - Cron Expression - Put your schedule here e.g. `30 15 ? * * *` runs every day at 15:30 UTC
3. Add Target - Lambda Function - Function = instance-manager
4. Configure Input - Constant (JSON Text) - Paste your event.json here e.g. `{   "tags": {     "Purpose": "lambda-testing",     "Testing": "true"   },   "state": "stop" }`
5. Configure Details - Give name and description and click Create Rule
